# NotePad2
Flask webapp to take notes and store in database for personalized usage

This project is a fairly basic one, and I'm using it as an introduction into the Flask microframework, database integration into python, and some basic HTML and CSS. The basic
flow of the program is a text entry into the webapp --> text entry is stored into a sqlite database in the backend with date and time stored with it --> webapp has page that
displays all the notes stored with their dates and times.
